Here is our first Flutter project, a joint portfolio created by [Johan Anquetil](https://github.com/JohanAnquetil) and me. We used this project to learn and practice Flutter.
Our design was inspired by the style of the newspaper "Lib√©ration."

You can see the final result here: http://johananquetil.fr/portfolio/.
